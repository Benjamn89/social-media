Welcome To Sted.

A site who built for being displayed in my portfolio as a medium/ big size project.
The site simulates a social network.


The tools i used when buiding Sted:
-) React
-) Redux
-) Thunk
-) React midlleware
-) Pure css/ css3
-) Firebase storage for uploading media.
-) FaunaDB (NoSql database - similar to MongoDB) -> Full contact/ control between front/ backend


Sted is my first medium/ big project.
During the buliding of the site i learned a lot, In fact every step forward that i took involved new learning (Not only in react,
but also in pure Javascript).

Sted contains more than 20 components with 7 diffrent states that was created by redux who communicate amazingly and effectively.


Have fun while exploring
